 * ============================================================================
 * Introduction
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Pictures can function as something other than just a visual for your game.
 * They can sometimes serve as UI elements or more! However, what they don't
 * have the ability to inherently do is to call upon common events when clicked
 * on by the mouse. With this plugin, the pictures bound to a common event will
 * become usable when clicked or touched!
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Instructions
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * In the plugin's parameters, you can set common event ID's to each picture ID
 * listed from 1 to 100 (max number of pictures used in RPG Maker MV is 100).
 * If the picture is has even a value of 1 opacity, that picture can be used
 * for a common event. There are four condition types that can be bound with
 * the common events:
 *
 * ---
 *
 * - CLICK -
 * If the picture is clicked upon, this will prompt the common event to trigger
 * if the common event value listed is above 0. This will trigger only once
 * until the player releases the mouse (or stops touching the screen).
 *
 * - REPEAT -
 * If the mouse is clicked and then held (or if the touch screen is pushed and
 * held), as long as the mouse is above the picture area and the common event
 * value listed is above 0, then this will trigger once every 6 frames until
 * the player releases the mouse (or stops touching the screen) or moves the
 * mouse outside of the picture boundaries.
 *
 * - HOLD -
 * If the mouse is clicked and then held (or if the touch screen is pushed and
 * held), as long as the mouse is above the picture area and the common event
 * value listed is above 0, then this will trigger every frame until the player
 * releases the mouse (or stops touching the screen) or moves the mouse outside
 * of the picture boundaries.
 *
 * - RELEASE -
 * Upon releasing the clicked mouse (or the moment the player stops touching
 * the screen) and releases the mouse above this picture and if the picture's
 * common event value listed is above 0, then this will trigger upon release.
 *
 * ---
 * 
 * Note that there are some behavioral changes in regards to pictures bound to
 * that of common events. Any picture that's bound to a common event will be
 * separate from the map's spriteset, and instead, bound to the scene. This is
 * so that in the event the screen is scrolled, zoomed in, shakes, etc., it
 * will NOT affect the bound pictures.
 *
 * This is because the pictures are generally to be used as UI elements and UI
 * elements best work under the practice that they do not change position.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Plugin Commands
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * The following are some plugin commands you can use should you want to add a
 * bit of control with the Picture Common Events.
 *
 * Plugin Command
 *
 *   EnableTouchMove
 *   DisableTouchMove
 *   - Allows the player to press a destination on the screen and move there or
 *   disables the player from using touch movement.
 *   
 *   HidePictureCommonEvents
 *   ShowPictureCommonEvents
 *   - Manually hide all pictures bound to common events or show them. If shown
 *   then pictures will return to their previous opacity value. Hidden pictures
 *   cannot be triggered to activate common events.
 *
 *   MovePlayer Down
 *   MovePlayer Left
 *   MovePlayer Right
 *   MovePlayer Up
 *   - Will cause the player character to move as if moving by using a 4-dir
 *   input (either via keyboard or controller). This is best used with 'Press'.

 *   TriggerButton PageDown
 *   TriggerButton Left
 *   TriggerButton Up
 *   TriggerButton Right
 *   TriggerButton Down
 *   - This will cause the game to simulate triggering the button command of
 *   one of those original functions even if there is a common event bound to
 *   all of the keys of that original function.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * Changelog
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Version 1.03:
 * - Disabling Touch Move now also disables the Right Click button and
 * on-screen Two Finger tap to prevent random menu calls.
 *
 * Version 1.02:
 * - Fixed a bug that prevented the MovePlayer commands from working without a
 * dependency on the YEP_RegionEvents plugin.
 *
 * Version 1.01:
 * - Changed this plugin's Imported setting to YEP_PictureCommonEvents.
 *
 * Version 1.00:
 * - Finished Plugin!
